# Software Development Lifecycle 

## Stage 1: Planning and Requirement Analysis

“What are the current problems?” This stage of the SDLC means getting input from all stakeholders, including customers, salespeople, industry experts, and programmers. Learn the strengths and weaknesses of the current system with improvement as the goal.

- Collect requirements (including dates) and project ideas from client
- Create a list of the current problems and proposed solutions

## Stage 2: Defining Requirements

Once the requirement analysis is done the next step is to clearly define and document the product requirements and get them approved from the customer or the market analysts. This is done through an SRS (Software Requirement Specification) document which consists of all the product requirements to be designed and developed during the project life cycle.

- Get client approval on SRS

## Stage 3: Designing the Product Architecture

A design approach clearly defines all the architectural modules of the product along with its communication and data flow representation with the external and third party modules (if any). The internal design of all the modules of the proposed architecture should be clearly defined with the minutest of the details in Design Document Specification (DDS).

- Wireframe design / data-flow representation
- API tables and docs
- Have client sign contract
